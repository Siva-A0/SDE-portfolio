### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Two Sum (#1, Easy)**  
   - Approach: Use hash map to store seen numbers; check for complement  
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)  
   - Code: `/DSA/Day1/two_sum.py`

2. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (#121, Easy)**

## Day 2

### Goals Completed

* [x] Solved 3 DSA problems on LeetCode: Move Zeroes (#283), Running Sum of 1d Array (#1480), Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (#122)
* [x] Learned Python list operations, in-place modification, and accumulation techniques

### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Move Zeroes (#283, Easy)**

   * Approach: Use a pointer `pos` to track where the next non-zero element should go. Iterate through the list, swapping non-zero elements to the position `pos` and increment `pos`. Moves all zeros to the end **in-place**.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day2/move_zeroes.py`

2. **Running Sum of 1d Array (#1480, Easy)**

   * Approach: Initialize `sum = 0` and an empty list `l`. Iterate through `nums`, adding each element to `sum` and appending it to `l`. Return `l` containing the running sums.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(n)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day2/running_sum.py`

3. **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (#122, Easy)**

   * Approach: Track minimum price so far (`maxy`) and current transaction profit (`profit`). Iterate through `prices`, update `profit` if the current price minus `maxy` is higher. If the price drops below previous minimum, add current `profit` to `max_profit` and reset `profit`. Return total profit.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day2/best_time_to_buy_sell_stock2.py`

### Python / Tools Learned

* Reinforced list operations and **in-place modification**
* Practiced **accumulation patterns** using loops
* Learned to track variables to calculate running totals efficiently

### Notes / Reflection

* Next steps: Solve more array problems and start exploring **Python functions and dictionaries**

## Day 3

### Goals Completed

* [x] Solved 3 DSA problems on LeetCode: **Find Pivot Index (#724)**, **Majority Element (#169)**, **Fibonacci Number (#509)**
* [x] Learned Python techniques for array traversal, hash maps, and iterative computation

### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Find Pivot Index (#724, Easy)**

   * Approach: Calculate the total sum of the array `t`. Iterate through the array while maintaining a running left sum `l`. At each index, check if `l` equals `t - l - nums[x]` (i.e., left sum equals right sum). If so, return the index. Otherwise, add the current element to `l`. Returns `-1` if no pivot exists.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day3/pivot_index.py`

2. **Majority Element (#169, Easy)**

   * Approach: Use a hash map (`d`) to count occurrences of each element. Iterate through the map to find the element with a count greater than `len(nums)//2` and return it. (Alternative sorted array approach is commented out.)
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(n)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day3/majority.py`

3. **Fibonacci Number (#509, Easy)**

   * Approach: Handle base cases (`n==0` returns 0, `n==1` returns 1). For `n>1`, use two variables `fib0` and `fib1` to iteratively calculate Fibonacci numbers up to `n` using a for-loop. Return `fib1` as the nth Fibonacci number.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day3/fibonacci.py`

### Python / Tools Learned

* Iterative computation for **Fibonacci sequence** (space-optimized)
* Using **hash maps** for frequency counting problems

## Day 4

### Goals Completed

* [x] Solved 3 DSA problems on LeetCode: **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (#26)**, **Squares of a Sorted Array (#977)**, **Pascal's Triangle (#118)**
* [x] Practiced in-place array modification, sorting after transformation, and constructing patterns with lists

### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (#26, Easy)**

   * Approach: Use two pointers. Keep index `i` to mark the last unique element. Iterate through the array; if the current element is different from `nums[i]`, increment `i` and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[x]`. Finally, return `i+1` as the new length of the unique elements.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day4/remove_duplicates.py`

2. **Squares of a Sorted Array (#977, Easy)**

   * Approach: Iterate through the array, square each element, then sort the list before returning it. (Uses Python‚Äôs built-in sort for simplicity.)
   * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1) (ignoring sorting‚Äôs internal memory use)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day4/squares_of_sorted_array.py`

3. **Pascal's Triangle (#118, Easy)**

   * Approach: Start with base cases for 1 and 2 rows. For larger `numRows`, build each row iteratively by adding adjacent numbers from the previous row, with `1` at the start and end. Append each new row to the result until `numRows` is reached.
   * Time Complexity: O(n¬≤) (due to nested iteration)
   * Space Complexity: O(n¬≤) (to store the triangle)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day4/pascal_triangle.py`

### Python / Tools Learned

* learned **two-pointer technique** for in-place array updates
* Used Python‚Äôs **built-in sort** after transformations
* Practiced **nested loops and list appending** to generate patterns (Pascal‚Äôs Triangle)

### Notes / Reflection

* Key learning: Importance of **in-place modification** and when sorting is acceptable versus optimal
* Struggled with: Remembering how to correctly build inner elements of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle
* Next steps: Explore **two-pointer optimized solutions** (e.g., for sorted squares without sorting) and practice more pattern-based problems

## Day 5

### Goals Completed

* [x] Solved 2 DSA problems on LeetCode: **Palindrome Number (#9)**, **Product of Array Except Self (#238)**
* [x] Practiced number manipulation, in-place array updates, and handling edge cases

### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Palindrome Number (#9, Easy)**

   * Approach: Check if the integer `x` is negative ‚Üí return False. Otherwise, reverse the number using `v = v*10 + n%10` in a loop while reducing `n`. Finally, compare the reversed number with the original to determine if it‚Äôs a palindrome.
   * Time Complexity: O(n) (where n is the number of digits)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day5/palindrome.py`

2. **Product of Array Except Self (#238, Medium)**

   * Approach:

     * Compute the product of all non-zero elements (`v`) and count zeros (`z`).
     * If one zero exists, set all non-zero elements to 0 and the zero element to `v`.
     * If more than one zero, all elements become 0.
     * If no zeros, replace each element with `v // nums[i]`.
   * Time Complexity: O(n)
   * Space Complexity: O(1)
   * Code: `/DSA/Day5/product_except_self.py`


### Python / Tools Learned

* Practiced **integer reversal** without converting to string
* Learned to handle **edge cases with zeros** in arrays
* Reinforced **in-place array updates**

### Notes / Reflection
